                    Power is among the most critical components of infrastructure, crucial for the economic growth and welfare of nations. The existence and development of adequate power infrastructure is essential for sustained growth of the Indian economy. The fundamental principle of India’s power industry has been to provide universal access to affordable power in a sustainable way. <a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=3daac32c66131be4JmltdHM9MTcwMDAwNjQwMCZpZ3VpZD0zODc3MDcxZi00MmEwLTY2OTktMzAwYy0xNDQ0NDNhNjY3MzYmaW5zaWQ9NTIzMg&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=3&fclid=3877071f-42a0-6699-300c-144443a66736&psq=ministry+of+power+for+electrical+usage&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9wb3dlcm1pbi5nb3YuaW4vZW4vY29udGVudC9wb3dlci1zZWN0b3ItZ2xhbmNlLWFsbC1JbmRpYQ&ntb=1" target="_blank">The Ministry of Power</a> has made significant efforts over the past few years to turn the country from one with a power shortage to one with a surplus by establishing a single national grid, fortifying the distribution network, and achieving universal household electrification. <br>

                    India’s power sector is one of the most diversified in the world. Sources of power generation range from conventional sources such as coal, lignite, natural gas, oil, hydro and nuclear power, to viable non-conventional sources such as wind, solar, agricultural and domestic waste. Electricity demand in the country has increased rapidly and is expected to rise further in the years to come. In order to meet the increasing demand for electricity in the country, massive addition to the installed generating capacity is required.<br>
                    India was ranked fourth in wind power capacity and solar power capacity and fourth in renewable power installed capacity, as of 2021. India is the only country among the G20 nations that is on track to achieve the targets under the <a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=8e0709b58c347103JmltdHM9MTcwMDAwNjQwMCZpZ3VpZD0zODc3MDcxZi00MmEwLTY2OTktMzAwYy0xNDQ0NDNhNjY3MzYmaW5zaWQ9NTMwMw&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=3&fclid=3877071f-42a0-6699-300c-144443a66736&psq=g20+Paris+agreement&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud29ybGQtbnVjbGVhci1uZXdzLm9yZy9BcnRpY2xlcy9HMjAtbGVhZGVycy1yZWFmZmlybS1jb21taXRtZW50LXRvLVBhcmlzLUFncmVlbWVudA&ntb=1" target="_blank">Paris  Agreement.</a>

                    <h2>Some energy saving tips </h2>
                    The current energy crisis is set to continue this year as the UK braces itself for soaring energy bills. To help soften the impact on your household finances, here are our top ten energy saving tips.
                   
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Insulate</b></li>
                        One of our top energy saving tips is to insulate your home. If you don’t have any loft insulation, installing it could make all the difference. Installing loft insulation in a detached house could save £380 off the energy bills every year. A third of the cost of heating your home is lost through the walls, so insulating them is a great way to save energy in the home. Installing cavity wall insulation is expensive but make a big difference to the feel of your home and can save you up to £140 per year on your heating bills.
                        <li><b>Turn Off your Lights</b></li>
                        If you have children, you’re probably already used to sweeping through the house shortly after they leave for school, turning off every single light they have inevitably left on. Turning your lights off when you’re not using them or when you leave a room will save you around £14 a year on your annual energy bills.    Replacing all the lights in your home with LED bulbs could also help you save.
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Watch your water use</b></li>
                        Switching just one bath a week with a 4-minute shower could save you £7 a year on your energy bills and keeping your shower time to just 4 minutes could save a typical household £45 a year on their energy bills. Think also about how much water you use when boiling the kettle. By not overfilling the kettle you could save £8 a year on your electricity bill and reducing your dishwasher by one run per week for a year could save you £10.<br>
                        <li><b>Turn down your thermostat and update your settings</b></li>
                        Turning it down by 1 degree could cut your heating bills by up to 10 per cent. You can also cut your heating bills by installing certain heating controls. If you don’t already have a room thermostat, installing one could save up to £70 a year. As we shift to more working from home, you can take advantage of a later start from not having to commute by setting your heating to come on later in the morning. If you have a timer on your central heating, set it to come on only when required and if possible get a smart meter installed, which is estimated to help reduce a household’s electricity use by 2.8% and gas use by 2%.
                        <li><b>Don’t leave appliances on standby</b></li>
                        UK households spend an average of £35 leaving appliances on standby, so make sure to switch yours off at the plug. Research has also shown that leaving electrical items like laptops on charge after the battery is full costs around £3 a year.
                        <li><b>Draught proof your home</b></li>
                        Fully draught proofing your home could save you money, as well as making it a lot more cosy! Professional draught proofing of windows, doors and blocking cracks in floors and skirting boards can cost around £200, but can save around £30 a year on energy bills. DIY draught proofing can be much cheaper.
                        <li><b>Insulate your hot water tank</b></li>
                        An insulation jacket costs around £15 and can save around £45 a year on your heating bill, paying for itself in less than six months.
                        <li><b>Use an electricity monitor</b></li>
                        Electricity monitors show you in real time how much electricity you are using, which can help you make decisions about your energy use and become more efficient. At the moment you can get an electricity monitor from around £25 online and they are easy to install yourself.
                        <li><b>Careful with your washing and drying</b></li>
                        According to the Energy Saving Trust, you can save around £20 a year from your energy bill just by using your washing machine more carefully:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use your washing machine on a 30-degree cycle instead of higher temperatures and save £10 a year on energy.</li>
                            <li>Only wash your clothes in your washing machine when you have a full load. Reducing your washing machine use by one run per week for a year could save you an extra £10.</li>
                            <li>Avoid using a tumble dryer for your clothes: dry clothes on racks inside where possible or outside in warmer weather to save £40 a year.</li>
                        </ul>
                        All savings are from the Energy Savings Trust.<br>

                <p>
                    <h2>What is renewable energy?</h2>
                    Renewable energy, often referred to as clean energy, comes from natural sources or processes that are constantly replenished. For example, sunlight and wind keep shining and blowing, even if their availability depends on time and weather.<br>
                    While renewable energy is often thought of as a new technology, harnessing nature’s power has long been used for heating, transportation, lighting, and more. Wind has powered boats to sail the seas and windmills to grind grain. The sun has provided warmth during the day and helped kindle fires to last into the evening. But over the past 500 years or so, humans increasingly turned to cheaper, dirtier energy sources, such as coal and fracked gas.<br>
                    <h3>Types Of Renewable Energy</h3>
                    <b>What is a renewable energy source?</b><br>
                    A renewable energy source means energy that is sustainable - something that can't run out, or is endless, like the sun. When you hear the term 'alternative energy' it's usually referring to renewable energy sources too. It means sources of energy that are alternative to the most commonly used non-sustainable sources - like coal.

                    <br><br>
                    <b>What is zero-carbon or <a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=a00574f0745af668JmltdHM9MTcwMDAwNjQwMCZpZ3VpZD0zODc3MDcxZi00MmEwLTY2OTktMzAwYy0xNDQ0NDNhNjY3MzYmaW5zaWQ9NTIyMw&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=3&fclid=3877071f-42a0-6699-300c-144443a66736&psq=low+carbon+energy&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvTG93LWNhcmJvbl9wb3dlcg&ntb=1" target="_blank"> Carbon energy?</a></b>
                    <br>
                    Nuclear-generated electricity isn't renewable but it's zero-carbon(1), which means its generation emits low levels or almost no CO2, just like renewable energy sources. Nuclear energy has a stable source, which means it's not dependent on the weather and will play a big part in getting Britain to net zero status.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>How these types of energy  work?</b>

                        Sunlight is one of our planet’s most abundant and freely available energy resources. The amount of solar energy that reaches the earth’s surface in one hour is more than the planet’s total energy requirements for a whole year. Although it sounds like a perfect renewable energy source, the amount of solar energy we can use varies according to the time of day and the season of the year as well as geographical location. In the UK, solar energy is an increasingly popular way to supplement your energy usage. <br>

                        Wind is a plentiful source of clean energy. Wind farms are an increasingly familiar sight in the UK with wind power making an ever-increasing contribution to the National Grid. To harness electricity from wind energy, turbines are used to drive generators which then feed electricity into the National Grid. Although domestic or ‘off-grid’ generation systems are available, not every property is suitable for a domestic wind turbine.

                        As a renewable energy resource, hydro power is one of the most commercially developed. By building a dam or barrier, a large reservoir can be used to create a controlled flow of water that will drive a turbine, generating electricity. This energy source can often be more reliable than solar or wind power (especially if it's tidal rather than river) and also allows electricity to be stored for use when demand reaches a peak. Like wind energy, in certain situations hydro can be more viable as a commercial energy source (dependant on type and compared to other sources of energy) but depending very much on the type of property, it can be used for domestic, ‘off-grid’ generation. <br>

                        This is another form of hydro energy that uses twice-daily tidal currents to drive turbine generators. Although tidal flow unlike some other hydro energy sources isn’t constant, it is highly predictable and can therefore compensate for the periods when the tide current is low.

                        By harnessing the natural heat below the earth’s surface, geothermal energy can be used to heat homes directly or to generate electricity. Although it harnesses a power directly below our feet, geothermal energy is of negligible importance in the UK compared to countries such as Iceland, where geothermal heat is much more freely available.<br>
                        <li><a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=a57e133f6224a514JmltdHM9MTcwMDAwNjQwMCZpZ3VpZD0zODc3MDcxZi00MmEwLTY2OTktMzAwYy0xNDQ0NDNhNjY3MzYmaW5zaWQ9NTMwNw&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=3&fclid=3877071f-42a0-6699-300c-144443a66736&psq=biomass+energy&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvQmlvbWFzc18oZW5lcmd5KQ&ntb=1" target="_blank">Biomass Energy</a></li>

                        This is the conversion of solid fuel made from plant materials into electricity. Although fundamentally, biomass involves burning organic materials to produce electricity, and nowadays this is a much cleaner, more energy-efficient process. By converting agricultural, industrial and domestic waste into solid, liquid and gas fuel, biomass generates power at a much lower economic and environmental cost.

                    <h3>What is Home Automation?</h3>
                    The simple answer is - anything you want it to be!<br>
                    <div></div>
                    Home Automation enables you to use your home's <a href="https://www.vesternet.com/en-global/pages/scenarios-smart-home-lighting-guide" target="_blank">Lighting</a> Heating and home appliances (such as washing machines, dishwashers and tumble driers) more conveniently and efficiently.

                    It can be as simple as remote or automatic control of a few lights, or it can bez a complete system that controls all major parts of your home.Smart Home Technology is anything that gives you automatic control of things around the home, turning it from "dumb" to smart.
                    <h3>Why Do You Want A Smart Home?</h3>
                    Not interested in graphs and figures? Simply set the system to manage your energy use in the most efficient way - turn lights off when rooms are unoccupied, reduce the heating temperature when nobody's home and turn appliances off at the socket to minimise "standby" power drains.Maybe convenience and comfort are your primary goals, so your focus could be on your family wellbeing - your Smart Home can monitor the air quality and open or close windows as required, or control your HVAC system to ensure your house has a constant supply of fresh and filtered air.<br>With the stresses of modern life nowadays, we're all likely to benefit from some form of assisted living and there's nothing quite like having your own personal assistant at your beck and call! Whether you're an Alexa fan, a Siri convert or an OK Google addict, a Voice Assistant can be used to interact with your Smart Home like never before.From controlling your lights, adjusting your room temperature, answering your phone calls, checking who's at the front door or triggering entire sequences of events from a single word, Voice control is no longer confined to the movies - now we can all be like Tony Stark and chat with our own version of Jarvis!
                    <h3>What is Smart Lighting?</h3>
                    Smart lighting is an advanced way to light your home. Smart LED bulbs contain software that connects to an app, smart home assistant, or other smart accessory so you can automate your lights or control them remotely, eliminating the need for traditional wall switches.Conventional light bulbs work by flipping a switch on and off. Sometimes they are hardwired into a dimmer switch, allowing you to dim or brighten the lights. However, this is generally the extent of the functionality of traditional home lighting.<br> 
                    <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS2jvQV8U7G5zjLqZ8C4jyHWXBlesguLTYTUQ&usqp=CAU

                    <br>
                    Smart lighting, on the other hand, gives you far more control over your lights. They are still connected to your home's power, but each smart bulb and LED-integrated fixture allows you to control it wirelessly with your phone, tablet, or smart assistant, such as Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa.
                    <h3>Smart lighting Benefits</h3>
                    The advantages of smart lights don't just stop at controlling your lights automatically or remotely — there are other, less obvious, benefits to switching to smart lighting.<br>
                    <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQdrkGPBLVUNrPjXm-L9uxG_mxhuV8DmqYO_Q&usqp=CAU" alt="img-thumbnail-6">

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Easily Dimmable</b></li>
                        Traditional bulbs require you to use a switch to control the lights — and nothing else. If you want to be able to dim your lights, you need to wire a dimmer switch into your wall. Smart LED lights, however, can be controlled — including dimming — via the app or other smart accessories.
                        <li><b>Energy Effeciency</b></li>
                        Smart LED bulbs last much longer and generate less heat than the original light bulbs, thus using less energy.<br> 
                        <li><b>Connectivity</b></li>
                        Using your smart lighting system with other connected devices such as cameras, audio equipment, thermostats, or home assistants allows you to create an entire smart home.<br>
                        <b>Bright Idea:</b> Since your lights are controlled via an app, you can see their status from anywhere. Never ask, <i>"Did I leave the light on?"</i>again!!!
                        <li><b>Automation</b></li>
                        Smart LED bulbs can be configured individually or as a group. You can set timers that automatically turn off all the lights at a specific time of configure your lights to turn on and off when you're not at home, mimicking your presence.<br>
                       
                        <li><b>Instant Mood Lighting</b></li>
                        Preset and customized light scenes create ambiance for any occasion, whether you're using warm-to-cool white light or colour LED lights and all you have to do is tap a button.<br>
                      
                        You may never have thought that you could improve your home lighting experience — but with smart lighting, you can. With just the touch of a button, you can automate your home lighting, control your lights with your app or voice, or set routines to make it look you're home even if you're not. With smart lighting, anything is possible!

                    <h3>Benefits of Electric Vehicles for the Environment</h3>
                    There is a lot of enthusiasm about the prospect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle">electric vehicles</a> and it’s about doing well for yourself and the environment, not simply looking good. Electric vehicles help the green economy because they produce zero emissions, making their effect cleaner, better, and more environmentally friendly than conventional vehicles.<br>With the development of EVs in the vehicle industry to substitute ICE vehicles, the emissions of air pollutants at power plant sites will increase. But the emissions of local road pollution, frequently urban, are expected to decrease rapidly.<br>The development of electric vehicles (EVs) can aid in the reduction of CO2 emissions and demand for petroleum goods. However, the benefits of replacing internal combustion engine (ICE) automobiles with EVs might occasionally be negated by comparatively higher air pollutant emissions from manufacturing plants. But the greatest advantage occurs from not driving an ICE automobile and avoiding local combustion-related pollution.
                    <img src="https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-1-1.jpg" alt="img-thumbnail">
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>
                            EVs can produce zero direct emissions.</b>
                        </li>
                        Full electric vehicles don’t need a tailpipe, as they don’t produce emissions. Traditional machines combust gasoline or diesel, creating energy at the cost of producing dangerous carbon emissions. The EVs are fully emission-free. The most common type of battery placed in EVs is the lithium-ion battery. These batteries can be depleted and charged constantly without contributing to air pollution.
                        <li><b> Cleaner Production</b></li>
                        Even when using fossil fuels, EVs contribute smaller emissions than ICE vehicles. Many electric charging stations use renewable energy to charge EVs. Still, some are powered by charcoal-burning and are thus considered dangerous to the environment.<br>Yet, truly when EVs are coal-powered, they still lead to lower emissions over their lifetime. Where the electricity generation is less dependant on fossil fuels, clean energy sources allow EVs to be indeed greener.
                        <li><b>EV battery product can be clean</b></li>
                        Although EVs don’t contribute much to state pollution on the road, manufacturing EV batteries can be dangerous if done irresponsibly. Nearly all EV emissions are well-to-wheel emissions created during the battery production process. As EVs are still a newer technology, industry standards are inconsistent with the energy sources used for making batteries, resulting in larger carbon footprints. But, this scenario has begun to change.<br>Today’s EV batteries have a carbon trace that’s 2 to 3 times lower than two years ago and growing cleaner every day. With better awareness, manufacturers of EVs are setting guidelines for their battery suppliers. For instance, they demand suppliers to only use renewable energy sources during product, simulators solar and wind. These sources can furnish the large quantum of energy demanded to produce EV batteries without dangerous emissions. <br>
                        <img src="https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/66-1.jpg" alt="img-thumbnail">
                        <li><b>EV manufacturer’s use eco-friendly materials</b></li>
                        One of the major obstacles that EV manufacturers are facing, is producing a functional yet lightweight vehicle. Lighter EVs have a lesser range and lower carbon footprint, but traditional materials make it tricky to achieve this. Still, recycled and organic materials are now similar to traditional materials. They’re feather-light, eco-friendly, strong, and durable.<br>Numerous conventional manufacturers use recycled materials for small components, but presently don’t use them for a vehicle’s structure. EV manufacturers are using perfect eco-friendly parts to make lighter and more efficient vehicles.<br>Weight reduction isn’t the only benefit of using recycled and organic materials, but they are also better for the environment. Using new materials like metals and plastics is unsustainable and creates pollution. Each natural or recycled material minimizes the environmental impact both during and after the EV product process. <br>
                        <img src="https://www.joyebike.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/joy-bLOG-aDD-1-1.jpg" alt="img-thumbnail">
                        <li><b>Reduced Noise pollution</b></li>
                        Electric motors are relatively much quieter, especially when compared to ICE cars and exhaust systems, and thus produce less noise pollution. While gas and diesel cars may be equipped with silencers to reduce noise, the exhaust headers are frequently louder than the standard equivalents.<br>While electric vehicles have a massive set of challenges ahead of them, their use could prove to be a huge asset to save the environment, how favourable an asset is, will largely depend on the type of vehicle as well as the source of the electricity.<br>Whether driving on the highway or just around the neighbourhood, travelling by electric vehicle helps you to protect the environment by reducing air pollution and smog. And not only does it feel good and do go, but the advantages of electric cars are also financial as well as environmental. As electric vehicles become mainstream, costs reduce and benefits increase, and thus more and more drivers are choosing to upgrade to EVs.

                    <h3><b>What are different types of EV charging stations</b></h3> <br>
                    <img src="https://www.beny.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Electric-Vehicle-Charging-Stations.jpg" alt="img-thumbnail"> <br>
                    <b>Level 1 Electric Vehicle Charging Stations - Ideal For Residential Use</b>
                    <div></div>
                    The Level 1 EV charging stations plug into a typical wall socket using a 120V AC plug. There is no installation or additional hardware needed for these chargers. The Level 1 electric vehicle chargers are common for residential use. <br>They are the least expensive charging stations accessible in the present market. However, they also take the longest to fully charge the battery in your automobile. These types of chargers are frequently used by vehicle owners to charge their automobiles overnight.<br>
                    <b>Level 2 Electric Vehicle Charging Stations – Ideal For Both Commercial And Residential Uses</b>
                    The Level 2 EV charging stations are ideal for both residential and commercial purposes to refuel the automobile. They are ideal for companies that want to provide rapid charging to their clients and to homeowners who need quick charging stations.<br>The Level 2 EV chargers must go through a suitable installation procedure, which must be carried out by a licensed electrician. They can be mounted as a component of a solar panel system. Moreover,these chargers have an hourly charging capacity of 10 to 60 miles of range and a car battery can be completely charged in under two hours.<br>
                    <b>Level 3 Electric Vehicle Charging Stations – Ideal For Commercial Use  </b>
                    The Level 3 EV charging stations are sometimes referred to as DC fast chargers. These charging stations, which are equipped with CCS2 or CHAdeMO interfaces, can extend the span of your electric vehicle by up to 100 miles with just 30 to 40 minutes of charging. Nevertheless, it is vital to remember that DC rapid chargers are often only applied in commercial and industrial settings.<br>Highly technical equipment is essential for the installation and maintenance of these DC charging stations. In addition, these Level 3 chargers are not compatible with charging all-electric vehicles. Some all-electric vehicles can not be charged with a DC fast charger, and numerous plug-in hybrid EVs lack this charging capability.
                    <h3><b>WHAT ARE THE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE INSTALLATION COST OF EV CHARGING STATIONS</b></h3>
                    <img src="https://www.beny.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Electric-Vehicle-Charger-With-Dual-ports.jpg" alt="img-thumbnail">
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Approval ,,,Expense</b></li>
                        The majority of residential and commercial charging station installations necessitate a permit from the local government. These licenses guarantee compliance with the electrical code for your safety and the safety of your property. A permit is mandatorily needed for the higher voltage electrical work as EV users prefer to install a Level 2 charger instead of the Level 1 (120-volt) charger. Although the price may differ from one place to another location, you should prepare a budget of about $150 for approval.
                        <li><b>Soft expenses</b></li>
                        Soft costs for EV charging stations typically comprise the access fee as well as additional costs needed to make the location suitable for the installation. Parking spaces with charging outlets, signaling, charger logos, parking space protection bollards, and other expenses are soft expenditures. Overall, the soft costs are likely to account for up to 5% of the total expenses.
                        <li><b>Material Expense</b></li>
                        Electrical supplies are an additional expense to take into account when establishing an EV charging station. If there is not a spare 240V outlet close to the installation location, the electrician will have to create a new circuit. The outlet, cable, and circuit breaker make up the bulk of an electrical circuit. Together, these parts make it possible for electricity to securely pass from the wall through the charger to the electric vehicle. <br>
                        The increased electrical capacity of the property and the distance between the installation location and the electrical panel both have a significant role in this expense. In other cases, extra materials or parts can be needed, such as a bigger electrical panel or conduit. In total, $200 to $800 would be a broad price range for the electrical materials. 
                        <li><b>Infrastructure Expenses</b></li>
                        Through the connection to the utility company, an EV charging station provides electricity to automobiles. However, it should be noted that these electrical conduits could need to be upgraded, and the price for that varies from $12,000 and $15,000 on average. Expenses associated with EV charging stations are mostly influenced by infrastructure. For example, it might be less expensive to connect to an existing 240-volt circuit. However, the expense to establish a dedicated 480-volt circuit might be more expensive. 
                        <li><b>Labor Expenses</b></li>
                        When installing a charging station, another cost-related aspect is the labor or the electrician. It is typically preferable to obtain a minimum of three comprehensive bids when planning to hire an electrician and base your decision as per their expertise, insurance, and reviews. The electrician’s expenses range between $300 and $1,500, based on the scope of the project and the city. 
                        <li><b>S0ftware Expenses</b></li>
                        Utilities need the installation of network subscriptions along with the net metering system software at EV charging stations in order to offer monitoring, safety, and data calculation for the location. The expense of the electric vehicle charging stations related to software can be around $300 per year.
                        <li><b>Power Management Expenses</b></li>
                        The EV charging stations will be more efficient because of a number of additional hardware and software capabilities called power management. The expense of an EV with a power management system is between $4,000 and $5,000. It raises the price of installing EV chargers but can decrease power losses, lower running expenses, and boost energy usage efficiency. 
                        <li><b>Maintenance Expenses</b></li>
                        Coming to the maintenance of the EV charging stations, one can expect to pay anywhere between $3500 to $5000. However, for the DC charging stations, the maintenance expenses will be relatively higher than this price range.

                        Energy policy is a document or set of regulations that include strategies and steps to be taken for energy saving. There are several standards based on which energy policies are made.  For example, ISO 50001, a standard made for energy management purposes has the following features:

                        <li><b>Energy Audit</b></li>
                        A regular energy audit helps in finding out the power losses due to different equipment, also the areas where most of the power is consumed and what steps are required to be taken in order to reduce power consumption without affecting the production. Energy audit consist of the following steps:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Walkthrough Audit</li>
                            It consists of analyzing the overall area major and minor loads, type of work performed there, number of staff, shifts, and timings, etc. The results through these audits can be like replacing old CFL lights with led and reducing the number of switches per luminaries etc.
                            <li>Detailed Audit</li>
                            it includes data collection, bills comparison, losses due to equipment, replacing old equipment with a new one and its payback period calculation and what major steps need to be taken by a facility for power saving which might include educating their workers about energy-saving steps and offering incentives to employees who show responsibility towards them.

                        <li><b>Renewable Energy</b></li>
                        The use of renewable energy is becoming common nowadays as it is a free source of energy and has almost negligible carbon emission. Renewable energy includes the use of wind energy, solar energy, biomass energy, and many more. These energies are utilized for supplying to load through the combination of power system equipment besides power electronic devices. The use of renewable energy in industrial facilities can also be a source of cost-saving and reducing demand on the utility company. For example: On industrial scale installing solar panels and shifting lighting load to it can help in reducing the burden of power generation greatly.
                       
                        <li><b>Power Factor</b></li>
                        ​The power factor shows the ratio of what amount of power is utilize for doing useful work from the power that is supplied. As most of the motor present in industries is induction motor. The power supplied to an induction motor is used for two purpose
                        <ul>
                            <li>Firstly, to do some useful work usually rotating work known as active power.</li>
                            <li>Secondly, to maintain the magnetic field known as reactive power.</li>
                        </ul>
                        It is preferred that reactive power should be minimum. An increase in reactive power reduces the power factor and low-power factors cause penalties on the industry. For example, two industries are supplied by a grid having the following data:
                        <br>
                        ​The given data shows that both industries may have the same amount of motors utilizing 1 MW for doing useful work but due to the difference in power factor the power supplied by the grid changes. Industry A will have to pay a high bill as the grid has to supply more power. So in order to compensate reactive power requirement, synchronous condensers , STATCOM, and capacitor banks are used.
                        <li><b>Motor</b></li>
                        <h4>Motor Rewinding</h4>
                        Due to overloading, voltage fluctuation, and insulation damage, motors winding temperature increases and starts to get damage. The rise in temperature leads to increased losses. It is said that motor life gets halved at every 10-degree rise in its temperature. For this purpose, we send motors for rewinding. But if rewinding is performed with a lack of care and precautions then every rewinding could cause a 1% decrease in efficiency which ultimately results in increasing the cost of electricity.<br>Following points should be under consideration while deciding for motor rewinding:
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the motor fails 3 times in its life than it should be replaced with a more efficient motor instead of rewinding it.</li>
                            <li>Capacity rated current, winding design and no-load current variation should be known.</li>
                            <li>No harm or damage should be made on core or insulation.</li>
                            <li>Making sure that no-load current should not increase after rewinding.</li>
                            <li>Rewinding should be performed in a dust-free environment.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Motor Staggering</h4>
                        At the time when the motor starts, it consumes almost three times as much power than its rated power. So for industries have numerous motors, it is recommended that each motor should be started one by one after some delay. This will reduce the overall burden on electricity generation end thus reduce the fuel cost.For example:
                        <BR>
                        An industry consists of three motors each of 10 KW and having a starting power of 30 KW for a few seconds. If all the motors are started in one go, then the surge of 90KW will appear at generation end. Instead of this if the motors our started one at the time then the surge will be much less.
                        <h4>Control Systems in Motor</h4>
                        Motors can be used at high efficiency using power electronics devices. For example:
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Housekeeping and Maintenance Plan:</b></li>
                        Proper scheduled maintenance and monitoring of loads in industries could increase the life span of equipment and also help in controlling the losses or failure. For example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lights can get dust easily and gets dims. Scheduled cleaning of lights results in proper brightness and increases its life span.</li>
                            <li>Voltage imbalance can cause the failure of the motor. Monitoring voltage imbalance and mitigating it can save the motor from large damages</li>
                        </ul>
                        As motors run continuously in certain industries, this can result in increased motor temperature. More overexposure to a rough environment also leads to body damage and insulation failures. A proper maintenance schedule for regular maintenance, inspection, and cleaning is a good option for motor protection from environmental adverse effect.
                       <br>
                        <li><b>Cogeneration/Combine Cycle</b></li>    Cogeneration means using exhaust heat for the purpose of heating or cooling. There are many industries out there that have a heating or cooling process so instead of wasting the heat of exhaust they can reuse it to generate electricity or provide heating somewhere else. Gas turbine and Gas engine generators also produce exhaust heat having high temperatures. This heat energy can be utilized instead of being released to the environment. The hot exhaust gases can be directed towards the HRSG (Heat recovery steam generator) which then produces steam which can be utilized for electricity generation using steam turbines or any other heating purpose. This is known as the combine cycle. These combined cycle plants are highly efficient and greatly reduce energy losses saving fuel costs.
                       <br>
                        <li><b>Heating and Cooling/HVAC</b></li>
                        HVAC (Heating Ventilation and Air Condition) are used in almost all process industries, commercial buildings, and homes. The following steps can be taken for making efficient use of HVAC.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Clean air vents can save up to 25% energy which could be utilized during pumping air into space.</li>
                            <li>The properly sealed room helps the AC or heater compressor to use less power.</li>
                            <li>Shaded windows can be used for the prevention of heatwaves where cooling is required. This reduces the electricity required to maintain temperature by air conditioners.</li>
                        
                        </ul>
                        <li><b>Load Management</b></li>
                        Due to changes in shifts, variations in weather, and different production times, demand never remains the same. Such variation in load causes an increase in the number of generators which proportionally increases the maintenance and control system requirement and thus cost increases. Proper load management like reducing unnecessary loads like lights, motors, and economic dispatch of power improves our energy savings in such cases.    Another method that can be employed to reduce peak is using control systems or 'Smart Grid' that is the supply from certain loads automatically cuts off or an alarm starts to ring whenever it reaches a certain peak.<br>Peak shaving can also be done through a distributed generation that is having supply from both grid and self-generation. Here self-generation means that having a gas, diesel generators, or UPS (uninterruptable power supply) present at your facility can be used as a backup supply or for peak demand-supply.
